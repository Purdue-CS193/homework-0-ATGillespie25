# Andrew Gillespie's first CS193 Homework
My favorite things about CS193 include:
- The ability to learn more about common terminal tasks, E.G., editing(especially with Vim)
- The opportunity to refresh my skills on tools that I have not used in a while, particularly with more complex git
- The ability to experiment and try new things with tools that I may already be familiar with, for example without this class I would have likely never learned that Markdown is a superset of HTML, hence the collapsable widget at the bottom of the page.
- Finally, the willingness and excitement displayed by the instructors and teaching assistants to help everyone succeed.
